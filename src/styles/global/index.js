// You can use this folder to keep the styles from components or screens
// If you choose to use this folder, I recommend do the same folder structure
// from src
/**
 * src/
 *  components/
 *  screens/
 * styles/
 *  components/
 *  screens/
 */
// This look like test folder

// But if don't want to use styles, you can create a file (something like style.js) for each component/screens
// Seen Home and Herder
// up to you.
